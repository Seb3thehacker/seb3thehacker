### Hi! ðŸ‘‹


I am currently working on a fork of Linx-server, which is a self-hostable file sharing website and pastebin alternitive.  
I also contribute to Molly, a FOSS fork of Signal with many improvements.  

I dont have much code on here because its on my PC rn and I'm super busy.  

I know HTML, CSS, some java, a bit of Python and some C++. I have decided to stick with learning Javascript. After that probably Java.
Ultimately my goal is to develop blockchain applications.  
i use Arch btw

If you like my work, I would really appreciate donations in Monero!
