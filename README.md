### Hi! ðŸ‘‹



Welcome to my GitHub! Some of my code is on GitLab but most is still on my PC.

I am currently contributing to Molly, soon to be a completely private messenger with support for Monero payments!
I am also working on a series of custom privoxy themes/pages.

I know HTML, CSS, some java, a bit of Python and some C++. I have decided to stick with learning Javascript. After that probably Java.

My goal is to be fluent in web development and Android app development.
Ultimately my goal is to develop blockchain applications.

If you like my work, I would love if if you donated in Monero:
