### Hi! ðŸ‘‹


Welcome to my GitHub! Some of my code is on GitLab but most is still on my PC.

I am currently contributing to Molly, soon to be a completely private messenger with support for Monero payments!
I am also working on a series of custom privoxy themes/pages.

I know HTML, CSS, some java, a bit of Python and some C++. I have decided to stick with learning Javascript. After that probably Java.
Ultimately my goal is to develop blockchain applications.
i use Arch btw

If you like my work, I would love if if you donated in Monero:

Thank you!
